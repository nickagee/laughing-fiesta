## Project Overview <a name="overview"></a>

The aim of this project is to develop an application that predicts an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  

I have also written a Medium Blog that details the steps and process that I took to complete this project.

## Setup/Testing Instructions <a name="setup"></a>

Git clone this repo to an environment that has the ability to train Machine Learning utilizing a GPU.  I utilized Google Colab to perform all tasks in this notebook.

## File/Folder Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Within the `main/` folder is where the mechanics of the application are found.

**DogBreedApp.ipynb** is the jupyter notebook that contains all the code for setting up and running the ML models and analytics.

**DataExploring.ipynb** is the jupyter notebook that contains the code that I utilize to look at the images in the dataset.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>

The data that was utilized in this project was obtained from Udacity Data Science Nano Degree.
