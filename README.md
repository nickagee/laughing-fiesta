## Setup/Testing Instructions <a name="setup"></a>

Git clone this repo to an environment that has the ability to train Machine Learning utilizing a GPU.  I utilized Google Colab to perform all tasks in this notebook.

## File/Folder Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Within the `main/` folder is where the mechanics of the application are found.

**DogBreedApp.ipynb** is the jupyter notebook that contains all the code for setting up and running the ML models and analytics.

**DataExploring.ipynb** is the jupyter notebook that contains the code that I utilize to look at the images in the dataset.
